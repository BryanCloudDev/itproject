# Project Details

This project is built with Spring Boot 3.1.3, using Maven as the package manager, and Angular for the frontend. When you start the API, all necessary dependencies will be installed. The compiled Angular project is located in the static folder. If you want to explore it further, you can check the "frontend" folder for more details. It was a significant challenge, although I couldn't complete it entirely, I gave my best effort and learned a lot. I appreciate you considering me and expecting the best. Thank you!
